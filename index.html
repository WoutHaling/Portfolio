            <h2>Hello, i'm Wout</h2>
            <p>
                I am an eighteen year old applied computer science student studying in Geel, Belgium.
                In my spare time, I am very much involved in everything that has to do with computer science.
                <br> I hope in the future to work as a full stack web developer, possibly in combination with his own company. <br> I have been very interested in technology for the longest time and I have been studying IT for 3 years now. I hope to expand my knowledge even more and possibly combine web and application development together. <br><br>To find out more about the projects I have made please visit the 'Portfolio' section.

            <h2>First Portfolio</h2>
            <p>
                This project is a school project. We had to make our own portfolio using the knowledgde we gained during our web development course. <br>
                Everytime we learned something new we had to apply it to our portfolio.

            <h2>Vondelingenluik</h2>
            <p>
                This was also a school project, the goal was to make a website for an actual company. <br>
                We made this project in a group of 3 people, we were told to keep it easy, clean and use certain colors.
                Along with some other information we recieved this was our end result, we later had to present and defend our website in front of a jury.
